My opinionated, vibe coded at the function level mostly, not for public libraries, run from docker-compose, 

- maybe C functions with a node calling mechanism, chasing bitwise speed on the C side, integrated with a node .... idk... should just be transferring numbers or lists of numbers, possibly struct-json.

```Node.js Native Addons with the N-API or node-gyp, or by using the Foreign Function Interface (FFI). ```

- No front end. 
- Node Unit tests ( 60% coverage? ) and some demo scripts of a "express app" flavor that should be mostly cannabilised unit tests. 
-- Unit test report libraries are fun and npm speciality.
